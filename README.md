# Sea Level Predictor  

This project uses **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **SciPy** to analyze and predict changes in global average sea level from **1880 through 2050**. Using historical sea level data collected by the **CSIRO** and the **EPA**, the project explores long-term trends and models future sea level rise based on past observations.  

## Analysis Includes  

- **Data import and visualization**: loading `epa-sea-level.csv` and creating a scatter plot of **Year** vs. **CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level**  
- **First line of best fit**: using *all available data (1880–present)* to calculate and plot a regression line extended to **2050**  
- **Second line of best fit**: using *data from 2000–present* to project the potential sea level rise through **2050** based on recent trends  
- **Plot formatting**:  
  - X-axis labeled **Year**  
  - Y-axis labeled **Sea Level (inches)**  
  - Title: **Rise in Sea Level**  

## Curriculum
